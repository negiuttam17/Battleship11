# Battleship11
This is a demo example where I used xunit test to complete TDD approach towards a traditional game 

This project will :
* Create a 10x10 Board for player 1 and 2
* Add the ships to the board based on user input i.e ship position and orientation(I have used fixed length ship.)
* Give chance to Attack and return Hit or Miss based on attacked and ship position.
* Declare a winner if all oponent ship are sunk.

The application consists of the following projects:
1) Battleship11 project
    * This project has all the logic, console result, variables used

2) Battleship11.Tests
    * This project has unit tests for one scenario and will update others 

I have used only one class to make this project as Program.cs
This class includes all the logic and functions to complete the game.
