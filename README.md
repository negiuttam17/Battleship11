# Battleship11
This is a demo example where I used xunit test to complete TDD approach towards a traditional game 

This project will :
1- Create a 10x10 Board for player 1 and 2
2- Add the ships to the board based on user input i.e ship position and orientation(I have used fixed length ship.)
3- Give chance to Attack and return Hit or Miss based on attacked and ship position.
4- Declare a winner if all oponent ship are sunk.
